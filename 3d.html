									<p>The following is a detailed description of of the second project in the university course VÉL403G. The objective of this particular project is to use a 3D printer to make a structure that can´t be replicated using subtractive methods (CNC etc.) and to document the restrictions of the 3D printer. The object can´t be more than 100g of plastic. The second part of the project is to 3D scan an object. Here you'll find the documented process of the project and a step-by-step description on how to do it yourself!</p>

									<h2>UndrinkaCup</h2>
									<p>It didn´t take long for me to decide what to do. I went with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_cup">Pythagorian Cup</a>, a.k.a. Greedy Cup, but modifying it slightly and put another name on the creation. I decided to make it as difficult as possible to drink out of by putting a handle that was way too low on the cup and way to small, ergo the name UndrinkaCup. I went with 
                                       <a href="https://tractus3d.com/materials/petg/#:~:text=3D%20printing%20with%20PETG%20filament,temperature%20of%2085%20degrees%20Celsius.">PETG</a> plastic because it´s one of the most widely spread food plastic and considerably safe to drink from (in case I ever wanted to do so).</p>
                                    
                                    
                                  

									

									
                                    <h3>CAD</h3>
									<p>It should come to no surprise that I began with drawing the object. If you want to draw exactly the same cup feel free to. If you´re new to Fusion 360 I recommend checking out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3qGQ2utl2A&ab_channel=ProductDesignOnline">video</a>. It helped me out a lot when I first got to know the software.</p>
                                    
                                    <span class="image fit"><img src="img2/undrinkacup1.png" alt="" /></span>
                                    <span class="image fit"><img src="img2/undrinkacup2.png" alt="" /></span>
                                    <span class="image fit"><img src="img2/undrinkacup3.png" alt="" /></span>
                                    
                                    <p>The cup itself wasn´t too difficult to draw. The difficult part of the drawing was the drainage system that the liquid would go through. Im sure there are many ways to do it but I used a function called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QimeZSqS_sc&ab_channel=TheFusionEssentials">sweep</a>, it came in real handy and I´m sure it saved me a lot of time. </p>
                                  
                                    <h3>Prusa</h3>
                                    <p>The name of the printer I used and recommend using is Prusa MK3+ so when downloading the software make sure to choose the right printer and a nozzle of 4 mm when prompted to do so.</p>
                                    <h4>Steps</h4>
                                    <p>First of all you have to export your drawing to an STL file format so open up your drawing in Fusion 360 and choose <code>File</code> -> <code>Export</code> -> <code>STL Files (*.stl)</code>
                                    
                                    Now just wait a bit for the software to do its thing. When it´s done uploading you can go ahead and run your PrusaSlicer software. When it´s up and running choose <code>File</code> -> <code>Import</code> -> <code>Import STL</code> -> <code>Your STL File</code> -> <code>Slice now</code>. Now would be a good time to get the graphic card from the printer and connect to your computer. You should be able to export the G-code to the graphic right about now (right lower corner) but before you do that you might want to check the infill of the object and the supports. I had to put on some supports at the handle because the printer struggles with printing horizontally. I recommend you check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?>
                                        v=6LLK9soDW88&ab_channel=Prusa3DbyJosefPrusa">video</a> 
                                    before proceeding. It helped me a lot. Now everythings ready, go ahead and export the G-file to the graphic card. When the upload is complete, eject the card and insert it into the printer. Now you have to get the plastic ready. Since I used PETG I had to put a layer of glues on the printing plate. 
                                        
                                    I recommend you check out this <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+use+a+prusa+3d+printer&oq=how+to+use+a+pru&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0i20i263i512j0i512l7j0i22i30.8121j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#kpvalbx=_CogbZJWTBfqGhbIP74KgoAk_43">video</a> if you´re struggling. Otherwise just press the button on the printer and choose your file and print it (it takes a while to begin). Fast forward 10 hours and 100g of plastic and the cup was ready and it worked perfectly. Don´t believe me? <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/t7I0xFI5IhY">See</a> for yoursel!

                                    <h2>3D Scanning</h2>
                                    <p>I decided to 3D scan my shoe. The main reason for that decision is that according to developers instructions the surface of the object can´t be transparant or reflective, both of which my shoe is not. For this part of the project I needed a software I hadn't used before (Zephyr) but thankfully it´s quite beginner friendly and easy to work with. Also, the developershave made some very nice tutorial <a href="https://www.3dflow.net/technology/documents/3df-zephyr-tutorials/">videos</a> of which I higly recommend. I recommend learning to take correct photos because it can be a little tricky at times. As I said, these are some great videos and I just followed them step by step. Your progress should be similar to this.</p>
